The NEVO codes used in this database are based on NEVO database (NEderlandse VOedingsmiddelen database).

Methods, materials and software:
A sensory panel was trained to objectively analyze and profile the taste intensity of foods based on the 5 basic tastes (sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami) and fattiness. This dataset contains the average (number of assessors and standard error) of the taste values foods, the details of the foods (brand, preparation, serving conditions), and which function they had in the study (reference, monitoring, most consumed, other).  More details on the profiling itself and some applications can be found in the papers that are referenced.
